## About the Collection

This site was created as a project for Professor Bateman's Information Organization class at the University of Iowa School of Library and Information Science.  It presents a collection of videos documenting performances of original piano compositions from 2017 to 2025.  These pieces were conceived through improvisation and experimentation without any training on the piano, starting in grade school, and none of them have been written down as sheet music.  Using my phone camera, I began recording them in practice rooms at Grinnell College, where I chose to keep the camera face-down.  Other recordings take place at my parents' house in West Branch, on an antique piano with a family history, and at my house in Coralville, on an old Korg Concert 5000 keyboard.  The recordings are not perfect, containing many errors and background noises, as well as some feline accompaniment, which I have classified as "contributors."  In my metadata, I have tried to describe the music based on the feelings or concepts that inspired them, but any listener's interpretations may be different from mine.  Overall, I take inspiration from nature, emotions, stories, and composers like Philip Glass, Erik Satie, and Yann Tiersen.
